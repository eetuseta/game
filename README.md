# game

This is extended version of rock-paper-scissors game. It should be running in browser soon.

## Usage

Run the program and play the game. It produces simple text based game of rock-paper-scissors-lizard-spock. Game instructions are printed as you go. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5Q6-wMx-K8

At the moment game runs one time, but with little modification it runs until you give it desired command to quit.

This is supposed to be implemented to a web page using clojurescript but as time being it has no such feature.
